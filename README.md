### Cone Calculator ( CEUCCC )
*Thinking: Hopefully this guy won't notice that i can't speak english very well.*

This calculator is at the moment **only for straight circular cones!**
It is enough to enter 2 values to calculate all data of the cone.
Unfortunately, there are some exceptions.

But first the explanations of the symbols:
#### Explanation of the symbols
- **r** is the radius.
- **h** is the height.
- **s** is the length of the mantellinie.
- **d** is the durchmesser.
- **a<sub>g</sub> (a_g)** is the fächeninhalt of the grundfläche.
- **a<sub>m</sub> (a_m)** is the flächeninhalt of the mantel.
- **a<sub>o</sub> (a_o)** is the flächeninhalt of the whole oberfläche.
- **V** is the volumen.
- **U<sub>g</sub> (U_g)** is the Umfang of the grundfläche.
- **φ** is the half opening winkel.

But now to the exceptions:
#### Exceptions
First the cases where tow values are given but aren't enough to calculate:
- r and a<sub>g</sub>
- h and a<sub>m</sub>
- h and a<sub>o</sub>
- a<sub>o</sub> and V.

Of course some things also can't work. These are:
r can't be something else than d/2 or bigger than s. Because of the Satz von Pyhtagoras. Because of this h also can't be bigger than s. 
Furthermore the Volumen can't be bigger than a<sub>g</sub> or a<sub>m</sub> if one of this values is bigger than 1. 
Even more no value which you type in can't be smaller or be 0.
#### Genesis
This program was created in the course of a project of the Computer Science Physics course to circumvent the problems of accurate calculation, as well as the bugging interface and other problems of Scratch.
